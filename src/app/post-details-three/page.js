                      Entilators will be taken from certain New York hospitals
                      and redistributed to the worst-hit parts of the state

                      New York saw its highest single-day increase in deaths, up

                      deaths recorded yesterday. The White House may advise
                      those in virus hotspots to wear face coverings in public

                      various parts of the state and give them to harder-hit

                      “I don’t understand why that’s not happening,” Dr Fauci
                      told CNN on Thursday. “If you look at what’s going on in

                      Korean immigrant, who was also at the governor’s
                      convention, which included a dinner at the Korean
                      ambassador’s home. As the first Korean first lady in

                      icon in South Korea. I just grabbed my wife and said,
                      Look, you speak Korean. You know the president. You know
                      the first lady. You know the ambassador. Let’s talk to
                      them in Korean, and tell them we need their help.
